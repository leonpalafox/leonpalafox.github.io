## 👨‍🏫 Current Courses

### Deep Learning
**Universidad Panamericana** *Master's in Data Science*

A comprehensive journey through the foundations and state-of-the-art of Deep Neural Networks. We start from the mathematical basics of the single **Perceptron** and the Universal Approximation Theorem, moving through:
* **Optimization:** Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, and backpropagation mechanics.
* **Architectures:** CNNs for vision, RNNs/LSTMs for sequences.
* **Modern Era:** Attention mechanisms and the **Transformer** architecture (BERT, GPT).
* **Generative Models:** VAEs and GANs.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning
**Colegio de Matemáticas Bourbaki** *Specialized Advanced Track*

An advanced course focusing on agents that learn from interaction. We cover the full spectrum of RL, balancing mathematical rigor with implementation:
* **Foundations:** Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Bellman Equations, and Q-Learning.
* **Policy Gradients:** REINFORCE, Actor-Critic methods, and **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization).
* **Deep RL:** DQN refinements, Double Q-Learning, and Offline RL strategies.
* **Application:** Solving custom environments and optimization problems in finance and robotics.
