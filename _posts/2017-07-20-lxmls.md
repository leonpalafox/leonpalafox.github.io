I am attending the [2017 Lisbon Machine Learning School](http://lxmls.it.pt/2017/) in Lisbon, Portugal.

This Summer School took place at the  Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico ([IST](http://www.ist.utl.pt/)) and covered from core concepts of Machine Learning to specific techniques of NLP. I highly recommed this summer school given that it includes practical workshops that reinforce the understanding of the topics.
