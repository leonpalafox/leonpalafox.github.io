I am currently at the [RIIAA](https://riiaa.org/) conference. Which is the first in its kind to attend themes and topic of Machine Learning in Mexico. So far it has been good, and I think the ideas behind it are very worth pursuing. 

However, I think they are inviting people that are no longer sensibilized with the current trends of ML and AI in the world.
