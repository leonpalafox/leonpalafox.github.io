I am attending the [2017 Data Science Summer School](http://2017.ds3-datascience-polytechnique.fr/) in Paris.

This Summer School is organized by the [Data Science Initiative](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/datascience/en) at [Ã‰cole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en). DS3 2017 covered a broad range of topics and speakers are top researchers on their field. A recommended summer school to get a better picture of the state-of-the-art on Data Science and new trends.
